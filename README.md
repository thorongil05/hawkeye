# What is hawkeye?
Hawkeye is an image search engine developed for the Multimedia Information Retrieval and Computer Vision course of the MSc Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering at Universit√† di Pisa.

It is a search engine based on the query-by-example paradigm: a user submit an image, the search engine returns the most similar ones belonging to the image collection. It uses as index a Vantage Point Tree and the MobileNetV2 for feature extraction. We extract two times the features: first, using the un-modified MobileNetV2, then with a fine-tuned version. 

The fine-tuned model is in the `\model` directory. Each file contains a description of the steps performed.

# Query pre-processing pipeline issue
During search engine developing, we found that using the following preprocessing pipeline gives us strange results:
```
query = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.load_img(path_to_query, target_size=(224,224), interpolation='bilinear')
query = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.img_to_array(query)
query= tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.preprocess_input(query)
query = np.array([query])
```
A careful investigation let us discover that loading the query using this pipeline gives us different results in terms of pixels, and so features, compared to what we obtain using the `image_dataset_from_directory` function. We decided to use the same pipeline used in the `image_dataset_from_directory` to avoid such discrepancy and have good results. Moreover, we investigate the performance of the two functions the code is available in this notebook: [Pipelines performance comparison](./pipelines_performance_comparison.ipynb)
