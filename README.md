# What is hawkeye?
Hawkeye is an image search engine developed for the Multimedia Information Retrieval and Computer Vision course of the MSc Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering at Universit√† di Pisa.

It is a search engine based on the query-by-example paradigm: a user submit an image, the search engine returns the most similar ones belonging to the image collection. It uses as index a Vantage Point Tree and the MobileNetV2 for feature extraction. We extract two times the features: first, using the un-modified MobileNetV2, then with a fine-tuned version. 

The fine-tuned model is in the `\model` directory. Each file contains a description of the step performed.
