# What is hawkeye?
Hawkeye is an image search engine developed for the Multimedia Information Retrieval and Computer Vision course of the MSc Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering at Universit√† di Pisa.

It is a search engine based on the query-by-example paradigm: a user submit an image, the search engine returns the most similar ones belonging to the image collection. It uses as index a Vantage Point Tree and the MobileNetV2 for feature extraction. We extract two times the features: first, using the un-modified MobileNetV2, then with a fine-tuned version. 

The fine-tuned model is in the `\model` directory. Each file contains a description of the step performed.

Project files:
- [Vantage Point Tree](./index_creation.ipynb)
- [Model fine-tuning](./model_fine_tuning.ipynb)
- [Feature Extraction](./feature_extraction.ipynb)
- [Performance Evaluation](./performance_evaluation.ipynb)
- [Search Engine](./retrieval.ipynb)


The load_img function of the Keras preprocessing returns different values for pixels with respect to image_dataset_from_directory. We did a performance comparison to see the difference in terms of efficiency and effectiveness: [Pipelines performance comparison](./pipelines_performance_comparison.ipynb)
